## Description
This app allows users to store their credentials and other social media account details. For users to use the app they have to log in 
or creat an account on the app. When creating the account credentials the user is prompted to either give there own password or allow the app to generate for them. They can finally save the credentials and view them.

## Technologies Used
This project was build using Python3.6.
Flask and 
Deployed on Heroku


## BDD
this app shows various news sources in the world. these sources are accessed from the news api and the secret api key. Once one clicks on the specific news source or desired news source, the link goes to a new path that shows the articles written by the news source and the date and time it was created or published. from there the user can skim through the many articles, and once they get an interesting news they can get to open the article which will navigate the user to the original page of the news source.


## Development server
Run `source env/bin/activate` to enter into the virtual environment and `./start.sh` to serve the app locally

https://wilbronenews.herokuapp.com/ to access the deployed application on heroku
